========================

QRev is a Matlab program developed by OSW to to compute the discharge from a moving-boat ADCP measurement using data collected with any of the Teledyne RD Instrument (TRDI) or SonTek bottom tracking ADCPs. QRev improves the consistency and efficiency of processing streamflow measurements by providing:

- Automated data quality checks with feedback to the user
- Automated data filtering
- Automated application of extrap, LC, and SMBA algorithms
- Consistent processing algorithms independent of the ADCP used to collect the data
- Improved handing of invalid data
- An estimated uncertainty to help guide the user in rating the measurement

Because QRev uses data filters, interpolation algorithms, and computations that may be different from WinRiver II and RiverSurveyor Live, the the discharge computed with QRev using default settings may be different than discharges computed by WinRiver II and RiverSurveyor Live.

Office of Surface Water Technical Memorandum 2016.03 recommends and authorizes the use of QRev for processing discharge measurments made with an ADCP from a moving-boat.

QRev can be used on desktops, laptops, and tablets running either 32- or 64-bit versions1 of the Windows operating system. QRev should be used in the field to process measurement immediately after data collection and in the office to review measurements. The graphical user interface for QRev was designed to work on tablets, so most controls are buttons, radio buttons, and check boxes that can be easily operated by tapping on the screen. QRev is written and compiled with Matlab and requires the installation of the Matlab runtime libraries.

NOTE: 32-bit operating systems will only be supported through about mid-2017 as Mathworks has announced that the 2015b release of Matlab is the last Matlab version that will support 32-bit operating systems.
